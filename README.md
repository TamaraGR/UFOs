# UFOs Sightings Data Overview 

## Project Overview

In this project we are creating a dynamic HTML page with a table that includes detailed information about UFO sightings. The data about UFOs is stored in a JavaScript array. We built the webpage using HTML and CSS, and the table's filtering abilities were built with the help of JavaScript. To customize the webpage we used Boostrap. An overview image of the webpage is below.

## Resources

- JavaScript (including D3 library)
- HTML( including Bootstrap)
- CSS

## Results

The users of this website can filter the UFO sightings data based on date of the sighting, city, state, country and the shape of the UFO. The users can use multiple or one filter. An example of such filtering can be seen below.

## Summary

The UFO Sightings website is simple and presents an article about UFOs and a table that one can appply one of multiple filters to. 

### Drawbacks

- [x] The presented in data.js data is limited to only the United States and only dates in 2010. Broader data should be presented. 
- [x] Perhaps the button for filtering should be brougt back to make the filtering more convinient. 

### Recommendations
- [x] The website only has one article, and it would be better if there are also news articles and other updates. 
- [x] The website could have a more sophisticated design.
